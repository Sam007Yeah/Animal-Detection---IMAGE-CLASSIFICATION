# Animal-Detection---IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
This is our final year project as 3rd Year BCA students, we built a model based on the concepts of transfer learning by using Efficient Net as our pretrained model, trained it on our data and evaluated it using metrics such as F1 Score, Precision, Recall and Accuracy as well as building a confusion Matrix
